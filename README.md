# Agartha or Hyperborea – Image Quiz (Tkinter GUI)

This is a simple GUI-based image quiz game written in Python using **Tkinter** and **Pillow (PIL)**.  
Players are shown a series of mysterious images and must decide:  
**Is it Agartha or Hyperborea?** 🌀

## 🧠 How it works

- You’ll see a total of **10 questions**:
  - 8 randomized images
  - 2 final questions where you must decide **“Is he from Agartha or Hyperborea?”**
- After each choice, you’ll get **instant feedback** (“Correct!” / “Wrong!”).
- Your **score** is displayed and updated as you go.
- Final results appear at the end of the quiz.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `Pillow` (for image handling)

## ❗ INSTALL DEPENDENCIES BEFORE OPENING:
```bash
pip install pillow
```
## 🌐 Coming soon

If you're from Agartha or Hyperborea and reading this — we apologize. Or do we?
