# Agartha or Hyperborea – Image Quiz (Tkinter GUI)

A simple GUI-based image quiz game written in Python using Tkinter and Pillow (PIL).

Players are shown a series of mysterious images and must decide:

🌀 **Agartha or Hyperborea?**  
🛑✅ **Is he allowed to enter?**

## 🧠 How It Works

You'll be shown a series of questions:

1. **Randomized image questions**  
   → *"Agartha or Hyperborea?"*

2. **Final 4 fixed questions**  
   → *"Is he allowed to enter Agartha/Hyperborea? Yes or No"*

- Button labels update dynamically based on the question type  
- Instant feedback after each answer (*Correct!* / *Wrong!*)  
- Real-time score updates  
- Final score displayed at the end
